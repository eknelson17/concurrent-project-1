##About

##To run the program
Compile and run as normal without any flags. The output should be a detailed list of what happened throughout the day. Each line is formatted like the line below.
11:14 AM Developer 22 would like to ask a question.
The last four lines list off the total time spent in meetings, eating lunch, waiting for questions to be answered and time spent working.
