#Concurrent Project 1: Software Project Day

by Kristen Mills, Emma Nelson, Ian Salitrynski, and Curtis Burtner

##About
This is the first project for SE441. To see the project description go [here](http://www.se.rit.edu/~se441/Projects/SWProjectDay.html).

##To run the program
Compile and run as normal without any flags. The output should be a detailed list of what happened throughout the day. 
Each line is formatted like this one: "11:14 AM Developer 22 would like to ask a question."
The last four lines list off the total time spent in meetings, eating lunch, waiting for questions to be answered and time spent working.
